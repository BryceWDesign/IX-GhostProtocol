## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Guiding Principles

- This project is about real-world impact, not hype.
- Security is not optional ‚Äî nothing goes in unless it can be reasoned through and/or verified.
- We favor minimal dependencies and clear logic over magic libraries or obscurity.
- Contributors are expected to act professionally. This repo is intended for open collaboration, not ego or ideology.

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

As the project evolves, formal testing will be expanded. For now:
