# IX-GhostProtocol

IX-GhostProtocol is a modular, developer-focused protocol and reference implementation for secure, metadata-resistant, peer-to-peer communication. It is designed to function without centralized infrastructure, storing no identifiable metadata, and offering true forward secrecy, onion routing, and zero-trust connectivity out of the box.

> Built for those who demand privacy, resilience, and real-world usability — not someday, but now.

## 🛡️ What Problem Does It Solve?

In today’s digital world, most "encrypted" apps still expose:
- IP addresses
- Contact metadata
- Server-based intermediaries
- Identifiable app-level fingerprints

IX-GhostProtocol eliminates those vectors. It enables real-time communication and relay across hostile networks (e.g., firewalls, surveillance zones) while preventing long-term metadata buildup or historical traceability.

This is not a VPN or Tor replacement. It’s a protocol layer for developers building censorship-resistant, privacy-critical, secure communication tooling — from chat apps to sensor relays.

## 🔑 Core Features

✅ End-to-end encryption (Curve25519 + AES-GCM)  
✅ Onion routing with multi-hop relays  
✅ Forward secrecy with rotating ephemeral keys  
✅ No user accounts, no central servers  
✅ Lightweight P2P transport with relay fallback  
✅ Pluggable transports (UDP, TCP, domain-fronting, covert channels)  
✅ Metadata resistance by default  
✅ Optional GUI frontend for non-technical use

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSER/IX-GhostProtocol.git
cd IX-GhostProtocol
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start a secure session between two nodes:

Node A: python core/session.py --listen

Node B: python core/session.py --connect <Node A's address>

(Optional GUI can be launched via gui/main.py)

📦 Usage Scenarios
Secure chat or messaging apps

Peer-to-peer IoT device communication

Decentralized sensor mesh relays

Surveillance-resistant coordination tools

Communication inside censored or air-gapped environments

🌍 About the Project
This repo was created to answer a clear gap in secure communications: a modern, peer-to-peer, metadata-resistant protocol that’s usable, modular, and doesn't rely on central services. It's built to be understood, extended, and deployed by developers and privacy-minded engineers across the globe.

IX-GhostProtocol is open-source by necessity, not convenience.

I believe the world doesn’t need another chat app. It needs a foundation for secure communication that won’t disappear when a company folds or a country blocks it.
