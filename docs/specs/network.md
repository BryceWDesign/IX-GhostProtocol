# IX-GhostProtocol – Network Protocol Specification

This document defines the networking layer of IX-GhostProtocol, focusing on secure peer discovery, routing, and metadata-resistant communication.

---

## 🎯 Network Goals

- Decentralized peer discovery without central servers.
- Anonymous and metadata-resistant routing.
- Resilience against network-level attacks.
- Support for NAT traversal and firewalls.

---

## 🔗 Peer Discovery

- Use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for decentralized lookup.
- Bootstrapping via trusted peers or static lists.
- Use of cryptographic identifiers (public keys) as node IDs.
- Peer authentication during handshake.

---

## 🛣 Routing

- Onion routing model with multi-hop relays.
- Randomized route selection to prevent correlation.
- Route length and timing variability to obfuscate patterns.
- Support for circuit establishment and teardown.

---

## 📡 Communication Channels

- Multiplexed encrypted channels over TCP/TLS or UDP (QUIC).
- Use of cover traffic and padding to prevent traffic analysis.
- Fragmentation and reassembly for message size uniformity.

---

## 🔄 Connection Management

- Automatic reconnection with backoff.
- Detection and avoidance of malicious nodes.
- Session management with ephemeral keys.

---

## 🔐 Security Features

- End-to-end encryption at network layer.
- Forward secrecy in routing.
- Resistance to Sybil and Eclipse attacks via reputation scoring.

---

## 🧩 Extensibility

- Pluggable transport protocols.
- Support for integration with mix networks or anonymity overlays.

---

## Network Performance

- Adaptive congestion control.
- Low-latency routing optimizations balanced with anonymity.
