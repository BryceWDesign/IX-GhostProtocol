# IX-GhostProtocol â€“ API Specification

This document defines the application programming interfaces (APIs) for interacting with IX-GhostProtocol for both end users and developers.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ API Goals

- Provide secure, minimal-exposure access to core protocol functions.
- Support integration into diverse applications and platforms.
- Allow both synchronous and asynchronous operation.
- Abstract complex cryptographic and network operations.

---

## ðŸ›  API Modules

### 1. Initialization & Configuration
- `initialize(config)`: Setup protocol instance with user settings and keys.
- `setTransport(transportType)`: Select transport plugin.
- `setRouting(routingType)`: Select routing plugin.

### 2. Key Management
- `generateKeys()`: Create ephemeral key pairs.
- `importKey(keyData)`: Import external keys.
- `exportKey()`: Export keys securely.

### 3. Messaging
- `sendMessage(destination, message, options)`: Encrypt and send message.
- `receiveMessage()`: Poll or callback for incoming messages.
- `deleteMessage(messageId)`: Securely erase message from storage.

### 4. Session Control
- `startSession(peerId)`: Initiate secure session.
- `endSession(peerId)`: Terminate session cleanly.

### 5. Diagnostics & Logging
- `getStatus()`: Retrieve current protocol status.
- `getLogs(level)`: Access logs filtered by severity.

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- All API calls operate within secure enclave to prevent data leakage.
- Endpoints enforce strict authentication and authorization.
- Sensitive data never exposed in plaintext externally.

---

## ðŸ”„ Async Operation

- Messaging and network functions support promises/callbacks.
- Event-driven model for incoming messages and connection events.

---

## ðŸ§© Extensibility

- Plugin hooks allow extending or overriding core API behavior.
- Support planned for bindings in multiple programming languages.
