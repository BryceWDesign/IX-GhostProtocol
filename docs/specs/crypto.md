# IX-GhostProtocol ‚Äì Cryptographic Design Specification

This document outlines the cryptographic foundations and algorithms employed in IX-GhostProtocol to achieve privacy, security, and metadata resistance.

---

## üéØ Cryptographic Goals

- End-to-end encryption with perfect forward secrecy (PFS).
- Resistance to metadata correlation and traffic analysis.
- Support for ephemeral, rotating keys.
- Authentication and integrity verification.

---

## üîê Core Cryptographic Components

### 1. Key Exchange
- Protocol: Noise Protocol Framework (e.g., Noise_XX pattern).
- Ephemeral keys generated per session.
- Mutual authentication using pre-shared or public keys.

### 2. Encryption
- Symmetric Encryption: AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Each message encrypted with unique nonce.
- Ciphertext includes authentication tags.

### 3. Hashing and Integrity
- Hash Algorithm: SHA-3 or BLAKE3.
- Message Authentication Codes (MACs) for data integrity.
- Hash-based key derivation using HKDF with salt.

### 4. Metadata Protection
- Use of onion routing for multi-hop message forwarding.
- Padding of messages to uniform size.
- Randomized delays and dummy traffic generation.

## üîÑ Key Lifecycle

- Keys generated and discarded per session.
- Key rotation policy enforced automatically.
- Backup and recovery mechanisms encrypted with user credentials.

---

## üõ° Authentication

- Mutual challenge-response with cryptographic nonces.
- Replay attack protection with timestamps and sequence numbers.

---

## üß© Extensibility

- Modular cryptographic primitives for future upgrades.
- Support for post-quantum algorithms planned.

---

## Security Considerations

- Side-channel resistance in implementations.
- Secure random number generation.
- Robust handling of cryptographic failures.
