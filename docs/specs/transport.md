# IX-GhostProtocol – Transport Layer Specification

This document describes the transport mechanisms used in IX-GhostProtocol to deliver encrypted, metadata-resistant payloads reliably and stealthily.

---

## 🛡 Transport Goals

- Avoid exposing network metadata (IP addresses, ports, timing).
- Support multiple physical and virtual transport layers.
- Provide reliability and optional message ordering.
- Facilitate fallback channels in hostile or censored environments.

---

## 🚚 Supported Transport Protocols

### 1. Steganographic Transport
- Embeds encrypted packets within carrier media (images, audio, text).
- Sent over existing channels (email, social media, file-sharing).

### 2. Covert Channel Transport
- Uses covert timing, packet size, or protocol header manipulation to hide messages in normal traffic.

### 3. Overlay Network Transport
- Utilizes existing anonymizing networks (Tor, I2P) with additional payload encryption and metadata stripping.

### 4. Sneakernet Transport
- Physical transfer of encrypted payloads on USB drives, QR codes, or printed media.

## ⚙ Transport Layer Architecture

- Modular transport plugins selectable by user or system.
- Automatic fallback to alternative transports if primary fails.
- Multipath transport support for redundancy and obfuscation.

---

## 🔄 Reliability and Ordering

- Optional acknowledgment (ACK) schemes implemented in encrypted payloads.
- Sequencing fields used internally to reorder messages.
- Retransmission logic incorporated with exponential backoff to reduce detectability.

---

## 🔧 Extensibility

- Plugin interface for new transport methods.
- Support planned for emerging technologies (mesh radios, LoRaWAN).

---

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

- Avoid fixed transmission schedules to prevent traffic analysis.
- Use randomized delays and dummy traffic padding.
- Prevent linkability by rotating transport channels frequently.
