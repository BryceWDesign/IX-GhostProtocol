# IX-GhostProtocol â€“ Storage Subsystem Specification

This document defines the secure storage architecture for messages, keys, and metadata within IX-GhostProtocol.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Storage Goals

- Ensure confidentiality and integrity of stored data.
- Prevent data leakage via metadata or access patterns.
- Support efficient retrieval and secure deletion.
- Enable offline and intermittent connectivity usage.

---

## ðŸ—„ Storage Components

### 1. Encrypted Message Store
- Stores all incoming and outgoing messages encrypted at rest.
- Messages indexed only by secure hashes to avoid metadata exposure.
- Supports message versioning and expiry.

### 2. Key Vault
- Secure enclave for storing cryptographic keys.
- Keys encrypted with master key derived from user credentials.
- Supports ephemeral and long-term keys with rotation policies.

### 3. Metadata Obfuscation Layer
- Avoids storing timestamps or sender/receiver IDs in raw form.
- Uses homomorphic or secure multi-party computation techniques where possible.
- Implements padding and dummy entries to prevent frequency analysis.

---

## ðŸ”’ Encryption Standards

- AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for symmetric encryption.
- Keys protected by Argon2id-derived master keys.
- Encrypted filesystem or database abstraction.

---

## ðŸ”„ Data Lifecycle

- Automatic secure deletion of expired messages.
- Manual message deletion triggers cryptographic shredding.
- Key rotation triggers re-encryption of stored data.

---

## âš™ Storage Backend Options

- Local encrypted file store.
- Embedded encrypted database (e.g., SQLite with encryption).
- Optional remote encrypted storage via anonymized channels.

---

## ðŸ§© Extensibility

- Pluggable storage backends.
- Support for hardware security modules (HSMs) where available.

---

## Security Considerations

- Protect against side-channel attacks on storage access.
- Minimize metadata leakage through access patterns.
- Ensure durability against power loss or system crashes.
