# IX-GhostProtocol ‚Äì Routing Specification

This document details the routing mechanisms within IX-GhostProtocol, focusing on metadata-resilient, stateless, and adaptable routing strategies.

---

## üîÄ Routing Goals

- Avoid central points of failure.
- Minimize metadata leakage.
- Support both direct peer-to-peer and multi-hop mesh routing.
- Enable plug-in routing algorithms.

---

## üõ£ Routing Models

### 1. Stateless Hop-by-Hop Routing
- Each node forwards packets without maintaining session state.
- Forwarding decisions made using probabilistic algorithms or preconfigured rules.
- Reduces traceability by eliminating routing tables.

### 2. Mesh Network Routing
- Nodes form dynamic mesh topologies.
- Routing via random relay with optional time delay to obfuscate traffic patterns.
- Support for message redundancy and path diversity.

### 3. Proof-of-Forwarding (PoF)
- Optional mechanism requiring nodes to cryptographically prove packet forwarding.
- Incentivizes cooperation in hostile or resource-constrained environments.

## üß© Packet Structure and Routing Headers

- Minimalist headers containing only cryptographic nonces and ephemeral key IDs.
- No source or destination IP addresses included.
- Routing metadata is encoded within encrypted payload or inferred through timing.

---

## üîÑ Routing Algorithms

- **Random Relay:** Packets randomly forwarded to neighbors.
- **Delay Tolerant:** Packets buffered and forwarded with randomized delays.
- **Directed Relay:** Encrypted routing hints guide packet forwarding.

---

## üîß Extensibility

- Routing module supports plugin interface for custom routing protocols.
- Future integration with Tor/I2P-like onion routing planned.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Routing decisions must avoid creating identifiable traffic patterns.
- Nodes must validate packet authenticity before forwarding.
- Denial-of-service (DoS) mitigation through rate limiting and proof-of-forwarding.
